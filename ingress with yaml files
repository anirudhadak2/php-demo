i will  give you one docker image use this and give me the yaml files for the creating ingress  path based routing anirudhadak2/new-app:php-demo
this is image and it expose at 80 port no. for service give the deployment yaml file for the 5 replicas and give service yaml and ingress yaml file also

Here are the YAML files to deploy your Docker image (anirudhadak2/new-app:php-demo), create a Kubernetes service, and configure path-based routing with Ingress.



apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: php-demo-deployment
  labels:
    app: php-demo
spec:
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: php-demo
  template:

      labels:
        app: php-demo
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: php-demo-container
        image: anirudhadak2/new-app:php-demo
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80


------------------------------------------------

Service Yaml 

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: php-demo-service
  labels:
    app: php-demo
spec:
  selector:
    app: php-demo
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP


----------------------------------------------

Ingress YAML (Path-based Routing):
This Ingress resource routes based on URL paths. In this example, /app1 routes traffic to php-demo-service.



apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: php-demo-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /app1
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: php-demo-service
            port:
              number: 80


-----------------------------------------------------------

Step-by-Step:
Create Deployment:
# kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

Create Service:
# kubectl apply -f service.yaml

Create Ingress: Ensure your Kubernetes cluster has an Ingress controller running (e.g., NGINX Ingress). 
Once confirmed, apply the Ingress:
# kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml


Access the App: Access the application via the Ingress hostname (e.g., http://example.com/app1). 
The traffic will be routed to the service based on the path /app1.

Make sure to adjust example.com to match your DNS setup or local hosts file for testing.

You said: Error
controlplane $ kubectl exec -it php-demo-deployment-558b9974b7-6qmbw bash
error: exec [POD] [COMMAND] is not supported anymore. Use exec [POD] -- [COMMAND] instead
See 'kubectl exec -h' for help and examples
--->

The error you're encountering is due to the new syntax for kubectl exec. 
To fix this, you should use a double hyphen -- before the command you want to run inside the container.

Here’s how to correctly execute a bash session in the pod:


# kubectl exec -it php-demo-deployment-558b9974b7-6qmbw -- /bin/bash
Explanation:

-it: Interactive terminal.
php-demo-deployment-558b9974b7-6qmbw: Your pod name.
--: Separates the pod name and the command to execute.
/bin/bash: The command you want to run (in this case, starting a bash shell).

Problem Statement -->  i  have create php deployment 5 replicas suppose  all replicas are access by service nodeport and when this replicas access by the user  
that all has to be isolated and the replica has to be associated with that particular replica through service ,
after refreshing the service nodeport  url  that user get the different replica this thing don't has to be happend , 
once user access the service and get the replica he has the same replica after the refreshing what should i do for this isolation.

-->


To ensure that each user gets the same replica even after refreshing the service URL,
you need to enable session persistence or use a sticky session mechanism in Kubernetes. Here's how you can implement it:

Steps to achieve replica isolation and sticky sessions:
Service Setup with Sticky Session (Session Affinity): Kubernetes services support a feature called session affinity, 
which can bind a user session to a specific pod (replica). 
Once a user connects to a replica, they will always be directed to the same pod unless it gets terminated. 
This ensures isolation and prevents the user from switching between replicas after refreshing the page.


Implement Sticky Session in the Service:

In the Service YAML file, you can enable session affinity by setting the sessionAffinity field to ClientIP.
This ensures that users' requests will always be routed to the same pod based on their IP address.

Example YAML for your 5-replica PHP Deployment
Deployment YAML (5 replicas):

---->

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: php-demo-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: php-demo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: php-demo
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: php-demo-container
        image: anirudhadak2/new-app:php-demo
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

------------------------------------------------------------

Service YAML with Sticky Session (Session Affinity):


apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: php-demo-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: php-demo
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30001  # Adjust if necessary
  type: NodePort
  sessionAffinity: ClientIP   # Enables session stickiness based on user IP
  sessionAffinityConfig:
    clientIP:
      timeoutSeconds: 10800   # Session timeout (in seconds), adjust as needed


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:
Session Affinity (ClientIP):

The sessionAffinity: ClientIP ensures that requests from the same IP address will always be routed to the same replica (pod).
timeoutSeconds defines how long the session remains bound to the same pod. After this time, the session will reset, and the user may be routed to a different pod.
Ingress or Load Balancer:

If you're using an Ingress controller or external load balancer, ensure that sticky sessions are enabled at that layer too, depending on the method used to route traffic.
By implementing session affinity, users will be directed to the same replica every time they access the application via the NodePort, preventing them from getting switched to different replicas when refreshing the page.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 Problem Statement : 


It sounds like using session affinity based on the client IP did not fully solve the issue of keeping users tied to the same replica. There are a few reasons why this may occur, such as dynamic IP addresses, shared connections through proxies, or when the session affinity mechanism is not strong enough to handle load balancing well. Let's explore an alternative approach:

Solution: Sticky Sessions with Ingress Controller
If you're using an Ingress controller, such as NGINX, you can configure sticky sessions (cookie-based session persistence) at the Ingress level. This is more robust than IP-based session affinity, as it ensures users are routed to the same replica based on a session cookie, regardless of their IP.

Here’s how to configure sticky sessions using an NGINX Ingress controller:

1. Ingress Configuration with Sticky Sessions (Cookie-Based)
In this solution, the NGINX Ingress controller is used to create sticky sessions based on cookies. Every user who accesses the service will receive a unique session cookie that ensures their requests are always directed to the same replica (pod).

Ingress YAML Example:


apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: php-demo-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity: "cookie"  # Use cookies for sticky sessions
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-name: "php-demo-session"  # Name of the session cookie
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-hash: "sha1"  # Secure cookie hash function
spec:
  rules:
  - host: php-app.example.com  # Replace with your desired hostname
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: php-demo-service
            port:
              number: 80


-------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity: "cookie": This annotation enables session affinity based on a cookie.
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-name: Specifies the name of the cookie used for session persistence.
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-hash: Ensures that the session cookie is hashed securely.
rules: Define host-based routing to the service.

-----------------------------------------------------


2. Service YAML (NodePort)
The service remains the same but without IP-based session affinity since the sticky session will now be managed by the Ingress.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: php-demo-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: php-demo
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30001  # Adjust as necessary
  type: NodePort


------------------------------------------------

3. Access the Application via Ingress:
Once the Ingress and service are set up:

You can access your application using the host defined in the Ingress rule (e.g., http://php-app.example.com).
NGINX will create a session cookie for each user, ensuring that they are directed to the same replica every time they visit the app.

----------------------------------------

Step-by-Step Implementation:
Install NGINX Ingress Controller:

Ensure the NGINX Ingress controller is installed on your cluster. This can be done via Helm or by applying the official NGINX Ingress controller YAML.

# kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml

------------------------------

Deploy PHP Application:

Apply the deployment file to create 5 replicas of the PHP app.
# kubectl apply -f php-demo-deployment.yaml

Create the Service:
Apply the service YAML to expose the PHP application using a NodePort service.
 # kubectl apply -f php-demo-service.yaml

Create the Ingress:
Apply the Ingress YAML to enable host-based routing with sticky sessions.
# kubectl apply -f php-demo-ingress.yaml

Access the Application:
After the Ingress is set up, access the application via the defined hostname (e.g., http://php-app.example.com).
Users should be directed to the same replica consistently as long as the sticky session cookie is valid.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This method ensures that every user will stick to a specific replica based on a session cookie, preventing them from being switched to different
replicas after refreshing the page. This approach is more reliable than IP-based session affinity, especially when dealing with multiple users, 
dynamic IPs, or proxy connections.
